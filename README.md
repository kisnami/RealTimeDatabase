# RealTimeDatabase
To store your instance value in temporary files untill the system connected network...

when my server system get connected to network that time all the temporary data which stored on the local file retrive from it and send to my site.

so this is process we don't considered about network issus whenever we meet network problem

I use local database, it save only username for my reference.
